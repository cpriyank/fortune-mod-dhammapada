All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded
on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts.
%
All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded
on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts
with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never
leaves him.
%
"He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"--in those
who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.
%
Hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love, this is
an old rule.
%
The world does not know that we must all come to an end here;--but
those who know the impermanence of it, their quarrels cease at once.
%
He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well controlled,
moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mara (the tempter) will
certainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky mountain.
%
They who know truth in truth, and untruth in untruth, arrive at
truth, and follow true desires.
%
As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion will
not break through a well-reflecting mind.
%
Earnestness is the path of immortality (Nirvana), thoughtlessness
the path of death. Those who are in earnest do not die, those who are
thoughtless are as if dead already.
%
By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and control, the
wise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.
%
Fools follow after vanity, men of evil wisdom. The wise man keeps
earnestness as his best jewel.
%
Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of love and lust!
He who is earnest and meditative, obtains ample joy.
%
Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the sleepers, the wise
man advances like a racer, leaving behind the hack.
%
A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness, who looks with
fear on thoughtlessness, moves about like fire, burning all his fetters,
small or large.
%
A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in reflection, who looks with
fear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his perfect state)--he
is close upon Nirvana.
%
As a fletcher makes straight his arrow, a wise man makes straight
his trembling and unsteady thought, which is difficult to guard,
difficult to hold back.
%
It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and
flighty, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind brings happiness.
%
Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are difficult to
perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list: thoughts well
guarded bring happiness.
%
Those who bridle their mind which travels far, moves about alone,
is without a body, and hides in the chamber (of the heart), will be free
from the bonds of Mara (the tempter).
%
If a man's thoughts are not dissipated, if his mind is not
perplexed, if he has ceased to think of good or evil, then there is no
fear for him while he is watchful.
%
Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and making this
thought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mara (the tempter) with
the weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when conquered, and should
never rest.
%
Before long, alas! This body will lie on the earth, despised,
without understanding, like a useless log.
%
Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or an enemy to an enemy, a
wrongly-directed mind will do us greater mischief.
%
Not a mother, not a father will do so much, nor any other person;
a well-directed mind will do us greater service.
%
Not the perversities of others, not their sins of commission or
omission, but his own misdeeds and negligences should a sage take notice
of.
%
Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without scent, are the
fine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly.
%
As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers, so many
good things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born.
%
As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will
grow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly
enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are
like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.
%
Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is
tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.
%
"These sons belong to me, and this wealth belongs to me," with such
thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not belong to himself; how
much less sons and wealth?
%
The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a
fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.
%
That deed is not well done of which a man must repent, and the
reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face.
%
An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly);
smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.
%
Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the
Bhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!
%
"May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this
is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be
done or is not to be done," thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire
and pride increase.
%
If you see an intelligent man who tells you where true treasures are
to be found, who shows what is to be avoided, and administers reproofs,
follow that wise man; it will be better, not worse, for those who follow
him.
%
Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is
improper!--he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be hated.
%
As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise people falter not
amidst blame and praise.
%
Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle,
longing for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people
never appear elated or depressed.
%
If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man
wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he
does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good,
wise, and virtuous.
%
A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and
follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to
a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where
there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all pleasures behind, and
calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the
troubles of the mind.
%
Those whose mind is well grounded in the (seven) elements of
knowledge, who without clinging to anything, rejoice in freedom from
attachment, whose appetites have been conquered, and who are full of
light, are free (even) in this world.
%
The man who is free from credulity, but knows the uncreated, who has
cut all ties, removed all temptations, renounced all desires, he is the
greatest of men.
%
If one man conquer in battle a thousand times thousand men, and if
another conquer himself, he is the greatest of conquerors.
%
One's own self conquered is better than all other people; not
even a god, a Gandharva, not Mara with Brahman could change into defeat
the victory of a man who has vanquished himself, and always lives under
restraint.
%
He who always greets and constantly reveres the aged, four things
will increase to him, viz. life, beauty, happiness, power.
%
But he who lives a hundred years, vicious and unrestrained, a life
of one day is better if a man is virtuous and reflecting.
%
And he who lives a hundred years, ignorant and unrestrained, a life
of one day is better if a man is wise and reflecting.
%
And he who lives a hundred years, idle and weak, a life of one day
is better if a man has attained firm strength.
%
Even a good man sees evil days, as long as his good deed has not
ripened; but when his good deed has ripened, then does the good man see
happy days.
%
Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will not
come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is
filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he gather it little
by little.
%
If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the evil
falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up against the wind.
%
Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into
the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world
where death could not overcome (the mortal).
%
Do not speak harshly to anybody; those who are spoken to will
answer thee in the same way. Angry speech is painful, blows for blows
will touch thee.
%
As a cowherd with his staff drives his cows into the stable, so do
Age and Death drive the life of men.
%
A fool does not know when he commits his evil deeds: but the wicked
man burns by his own deeds, as if burnt by fire.
%
Like a well-trained horse when touched by the whip, be ye active
and lively, and by faith, by virtue, by energy, by meditation, by
discernment of the law you will overcome this great pain (of reproof),
perfect in knowledge and in behaviour, and never forgetful.
%
Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the
arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; good people fashion themselves.
%
How is there laughter, how is there joy, as this world is always
burning? Why do you not seek a light, ye who are surrounded by darkness?
%
This body is wasted, full of sickness, and frail; this heap of
corruption breaks to pieces, life indeed ends in death.
%
Those white bones, like gourds thrown away in the autumn, what
pleasure is there in looking at them?
%
The brilliant chariots of kings are destroyed, the body also
approaches destruction, but the virtue of good people never approaches
destruction,--thus do the good say to the good.
%
A man who has learnt little, grows old like an ox; his flesh grows,
but his knowledge does not grow.
%
Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained
treasure in their youth, lie, like broken bows, sighing after the past.
%
The evil done by oneself, self-begotten, self-bred, crushes the
foolish, as a diamond breaks a precious stone.
%
Bad deeds, and deeds hurtful to ourselves, are easy to do; what is
beneficial and good, that is very difficult to do.
%
By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one suffers; by oneself
evil is left undone, by oneself one is purified. Purity and impurity
belong to oneself, no one can purify another.
%
Let no one forget his own duty for the sake of another's, however
great; let a man, after he has discerned his own duty, be always
attentive to his duty.
%
Come, look at this glittering world, like unto a royal chariot; the
foolish are immersed in it, but the wise do not touch it.
%
He who formerly was reckless and afterwards became sober, brightens
up this world, like the moon when freed from clouds.
%
He whose evil deeds are covered by good deeds, brightens up this
world, like the moon when freed from clouds.
%
Even the gods envy those who are awakened and not forgetful, who
are given to meditation, who are wise, and who delight in the repose of
retirement (from the world).
%
The Awakened call patience the highest penance, long-suffering the
highest Nirvana; for he is not an anchorite (pravragita) who strikes
others, he is not an ascetic (sramana) who insults others.
%
Not to blame, not to strike, to live restrained under the law,
to be moderate in eating, to sleep and sit alone, and to dwell on the
highest thoughts,--this is the teaching of the Awakened.
%
There is no satisfying lusts, even by a shower of gold pieces; he
who knows that lusts have a short taste and cause pain, he is wise;
%
Even in heavenly pleasures he finds no satisfaction, the disciple
who is fully awakened delights only in the destruction of all desires.
%
He who pays homage to those who deserve homage, whether the
awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have overcome the host
(of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he who pays homage to
such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his merit can never be
measured by anybody.
%
Let us live happily then, not hating those who hate us! among men
who hate us let us dwell free from hatred!
Let us live happily then, free from greed among the greedy! among
men who are greedy let us dwell free from greed!
Let us live happily then, though we call nothing our own! We shall
be like the bright gods, feeding on happiness!
%
Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy. He who has
given up both victory and defeat, he, the contented, is happy.
%
There is no fire like passion; there is no losing throw like
hatred; there is no pain like this body; there is no happiness higher
than rest.
%
Hunger is the worst of diseases, the body the greatest of pains; if
one knows this truly, that is Nirvana, the highest happiness.
Health is the greatest of gifts, contentedness the best riches;
trust is the best of relationships, Nirvana the highest happiness.
%
He who has tasted the sweetness of solitude and tranquillity,
is free from fear and free from sin.
%
He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give himself to
meditation, forgetting the real aim (of life) and grasping at pleasure,
will in time envy him who has exerted himself in meditation.
%
Let no man ever look for what is pleasant, or what is unpleasant.
Not to see what is pleasant is pain, and it is pain to see what is
unpleasant.
Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the beloved is evil.
Those who love nothing and hate nothing, have no fetters.
%
From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes fear; he who is free
from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.
From affection comes grief, from affection comes fear; he who is
free from affection knows neither grief nor fear.
From love comes grief, from love comes fear; he who is free from
love knows neither grief nor fear.
%
He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is just, speaks the
truth, and does what is his own business, him the world will hold dear.
%
Let a man leave anger, let him forsake pride, let him overcome all
bondage! No sufferings befall the man who is not attached to name and
form, and who calls nothing his own.
%
He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I call a
real driver; other people are but holding the reins.
%
The sages who injure nobody, and who always control their body,
they will go to the unchangeable place (Nirvana), where, if they have
gone, they will suffer no more.
%
Those who are ever watchful, who study day and night, and who
strive after Nirvana, their passions will come to an end.
%
This is an old saying, O Atula (uncomparable), this is not only of today: `They
blame him who sits silent, they blame him who speaks much, they also
blame him who says little; there is no one on earth who is not blamed.'
There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man who
is always blamed, or a man who is always praised.
%
Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy tongue! Leave
the sins of the tongue, and practise virtue with thy tongue!
%
The wise who control their body, who control their tongue, the wise
who control their mind, are indeed well controlled.
%
Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of death (Yama) have
come near to thee; thou standest at the door of thy departure, and thou
hast no provision for thy journey.
%
As the impurity which springs from the iron, when it springs from
it, destroys it; thus do a transgressor's own works lead him to the evil
path.
%
The taint of prayers is non-repetition; the taint of houses,
non-repair; the taint of the body is sloth; the taint of a watchman,
thoughtlessness.
%
But there is a taint worse than all taints,--ignorance is
the greatest taint.
%
Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame, a crow hero, a
mischief-maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched fellow.
But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks for
what is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and intelligent.
%
The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself is
difficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like chaff,
but his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides the bad die from the
gambler.
%
A man is not just if he carries a matter by violence; no, he
who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned and leads others,
not by violence, but by law and equity, and who is guarded by the law
and intelligent, he is called just.
%
A man is not learned because he talks much; he who is patient, free
from hatred and fear, he is called learned.
%
An envious greedy, dishonest man does not become respectable by
means of much talking only, or by the beauty of his complexion.
%
A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures living creatures;
because he has pity on all living creatures, therefore is a man called
Ariya.
%
Bhikshu, be not confident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of
desires.
%
You yourself must make an effort. The Tathagatas (Buddhas) are only
preachers. The thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage
of Mara (the temper).
%
`All created things perish,' `All created things are grief and pain,'
`All forms are unreal,' he who knows and sees this becomes passive
in pain;
%
He who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise, who, though
young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will and thought are weak,
that lazy and idle man will never find the way to knowledge.
%
`Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and summer,' thus
the fool meditates, and does not think of his death.
Death comes and carries off that man, praised for his children and
flocks, his mind distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.
Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations; there is no help
from kinsfolk for one whom death has seized.
A wise and good man who knows the meaning of this, should quickly
clear the way that leads to Nirvana.
%
But they whose whole watchfulness is always directed to their body,
who do not follow what ought not to be done, and who steadfastly do what
ought to be done, the desires of such watchful and wise people will come
to an end.
%
He alone who, without ceasing, practises the duty of sitting
alone and sleeping alone, he, subduing himself, will rejoice in the
destruction of all desires alone, as if living in a forest.
%
Four things does a wreckless man gain who covets his neighbour's
wife,--a bad reputation, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly, punishment, and
lastly, hell.
%
An act carelessly performed, a broken vow, and hesitating obedience
to discipline, all this brings no great reward.
%
If anything is to be done, let a man do it, let him attack it
vigorously! A careless pilgrim only scatters the dust of his passions
more widely.
%
Silently shall I endure abuse as the elephant in battle endures the
arrow sent from the bow: for the world is ill-natured.
They lead a tamed elephant to battle, the king mounts a tamed
elephant; the tamed is the best among men, he who silently endures
abuse.
Mules are good, if tamed, and noble Sindhu horses, and elephants
with large tusks; but he who tames himself is better still.
%
Be not thoughtless, watch your thoughts! Draw yourself out of the
evil way, like an elephant sunk in mud.
%
It is better to live alone, there is no companionship with a fool;
let a man walk alone, let him commit no sin, with few wishes, like an
elephant in the forest.
%
If an occasion arises, friends are pleasant; enjoyment is pleasant,
whatever be the cause; a good work is pleasant in the hour of death; the
giving up of all grief is pleasant.
%
As a tree, even though it has been cut down, is firm so long as its
root is safe, and grows again, thus, unless the feeders of thirst are
destroyed, the pain (of life) will return again and again.
%
Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared hare;
let therefore the mendicant drive out thirst, by striving after
passionlessness for himself.
%
Those who are slaves to passions, run down with the stream (of
desires), as a spider runs down the web which he has made himself;
when they have cut this, at last, wise people leave the world free from
cares, leaving all affection behind.
%
Give up what is before, give up what is behind, give up what is in
the middle, when thou goest to the other shore of existence; if thy mind
is altogether free, thou wilt not again enter into birth and decay.
%
If a man is tossed about by doubts, full of strong passions, and
yearning only for what is delightful, his thirst will grow more and
more, and he will indeed make his fetters strong.
%
A Bhikshu who, though he receives little, does not despise what he
has received, even the gods will praise him, if his life is pure, and if
he is not slothful.
%
He who never identifies himself with name and form, and does not
grieve over what is no more, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.
%
The Bhikshu who acts with kindness, who is calm in the doctrine
of Buddha, will reach the quiet place (Nirvana), cessation of natural
desires, and happiness.
%
Without knowledge there is no meditation, without meditation
there is no knowledge: he who has knowledge and meditation is near unto
Nirvana.
%
And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu: watchfulness
over the senses, contentedness, restraint under the law; keep noble
friends whose life is pure, and who are not slothful.
Let him live in charity, let him be perfect in his duties; then in
the fullness of delight he will make an end of suffering.
%
Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by thyself, thus
self-protected and attentive wilt thou live happily, O Bhikshu!
%
For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of self; therefore
curb thyself as the merchant curbs a good horse.
%
He who is thoughtful, blameless, settled, dutiful, without
passions, and who has attained the highest end, him I call indeed a
Brahmana.
The sun is bright by day, the moon shines by night, the warrior
is bright in his armour, the Brahmana is bright in his meditation; but
Buddha, the Awakened, is bright with splendour day and night.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not offend by body, word, or
thought, and is controlled on these three points.
%
A man does not become a Brahmana by his platted hair, by his
family, or by birth; in whom there is truth and righteousness, he is
blessed, he is a Brahmana.
I do not call a man a Brahmana because of his origin or of his
mother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is
free from all attachments, him I call indeed a Brahmana.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut all fetters, who never
trembles, is independent and unshackled.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, though he has committed no
offence, endures reproach, bonds, and stripes, who has endurance for his
force, and strength for his army.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is free from anger, dutiful,
virtuous, without appetite, who is subdued, and has received his last
body.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not cling to pleasures, like
water on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on the point of a needle.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who finds no fault with other beings,
whether feeble or strong, and does not kill nor cause slaughter.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is tolerant with the intolerant,
mild with fault-finders, and free from passion among the passionate.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana from whom anger and hatred, pride and
envy have dropt like a mustard seed from the point of a needle.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who takes nothing in the world that is
not given him, be it long or short, small or large, good or bad.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has no interests, and when he has
understood (the truth), does not say How, how? And who has reached the
depth of the Immortal.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world is above good and
evil, above the bondage of both, free from grief from sin, and from
impurity.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is bright like the moon, pure,
serene, undisturbed, and in whom all gaiety is extinct.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has traversed this miry road, the
impassable world and its vanity, who has gone through, and reached
the other shore, is thoughtful, guileless, free from doubts, free from
attachment, and content.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world, leaving all
desires, travels about without a home, and in whom all concupiscence is
extinct.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, leaving all longings, travels
about without a home, and in whom all covetousness is extinct.
%
Him I call indeed a Brahmana who calls nothing his own, whether it
be before, behind, or between, who is poor, and free from the love of
the world.
